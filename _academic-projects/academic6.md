June 2020 – December 2020

- Investigated the correlation between galactic distance and recessional velocity to approximate Hubble’s constant and, by extension, the age of the universe  
- Leveraged SIMBAD astronomical database to source high-redshift galaxy data and apply regression techniques to analyze large-scale cosmic expansion
