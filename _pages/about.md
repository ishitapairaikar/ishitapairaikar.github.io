I’m a final-year Computer Engineering student at NC State University, minoring in Philosophy (**graduating Dec ’25**). My research focuses on **human-AI interaction, ethical design, and intelligent systems**, with the goal of creating AI that **listens and adapts** — not just responds.  

At **NC State’s NeuroComputational Ethics Research Group**, I study **moral decision-making in healthcare robotics** and develop **speech-based systems** to support independent aging. At the **University of Auckland’s Empathic Computing Lab**, I contribute to **emotion-aware AI research** grounded in wearable sensing, self-reports, and **Māori Data Sovereignty**. I have also advocated for **responsible AI and policy** through the **Future World Alliance** and as a **Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (UK)**.  

My path has been shaped by **interdisciplinary collaborations** — from **startups** to **policy groups** — and a background in classical dance, public speaking, and **cultural representation**. As **2nd Runner-Up at Miss India USA 2023** and a **Top 5 finalist at Miss India Worldwide 2024**, I’ve learned to **connect across cultures** and lead with both presence and purpose.  

I’m currently applying to **PhD programs in Human-Computer Interaction**. If you’re working on technology that combines **AI, ethics, and human-centered design**, I’d love to connect!
