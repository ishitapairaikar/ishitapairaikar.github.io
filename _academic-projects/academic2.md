January 2025 – May 2025

- Replicated a published paper on PCA + linear regression EEG-to-text baseline on one patient to establish personalized performance  
- Developed and trained a 5-layer CNN after detrending, 70–170 Hz bandpass filtering, 50/10 ms sliding windowing, Hilbert envelope and log-Mel spectrogram extraction, PCA to 50 components, and 10-fold cross-validation -- to generalize decoding across 10 epilepsy patients  
- Demonstrated substantial performance gains over the personalized baseline in EEG-to-text translation for speech-impaired communication research applying signal preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of noisy EEG data, enabling accurate decoding of speech patterns
