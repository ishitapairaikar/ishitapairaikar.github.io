I didn’t get into AI because it was trendy.
I got into it because I couldn’t stop asking: 𝑯𝒐𝒘 𝒅𝒐 𝒘𝒆 𝒅𝒆𝒔𝒊𝒈𝒏 𝒕𝒆𝒄𝒉𝒏𝒐𝒍𝒐𝒈𝒚 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒍𝒚 𝒖𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒔 𝒑𝒆𝒐𝒑𝒍𝒆?

I’m a Computer Engineering student at NC State University, minoring in Philosophy (graduating December 25'). My work lives at the intersection of intelligent systems and ethical reflection, because building AI without considering its real-world consequences isn’t just incomplete — it’s irresponsible.

At NC State’s NeuroComputational Ethics Research Group, I study moral decision-making in healthcare robotics and develop speech-based systems to support independent aging. At the University of Auckland’s Empathic Computing Lab, I support emotion-aware AI research grounded in wearable data, self-reports, and Māori Data Sovereignty. These aren’t just technical challenges — they’re social, emotional, and ethical ones. Solving them means listening to people, not just data.

Beyond the lab, I advocate for responsible AI and policy through my work with Future World Alliance and as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (UK). These roles allow me to bridge research and policy and help shape how AI is built, governed, and understood across sectors.

I thrive in a VUCA world — 𝒗𝒐𝒍𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚, 𝒖𝒏𝒄𝒆𝒓𝒕𝒂𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒚, 𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒆𝒙𝒊𝒕𝒚, 𝒂𝒎𝒃𝒊𝒈𝒖𝒊𝒕𝒚. Not everyone likes chaos. I lean into it. It’s where I lead with 𝒗𝒊𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏, 𝒖𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒊𝒏𝒈, 𝒄𝒍𝒂𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒚, and 𝒂𝒈𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚. To me, engineering is about more than tools — it’s about critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and a deep understanding of the people you’re building for.

I’m especially passionate about interdisciplinary work. I’ve collaborated with startups, researchers, and policymakers — always drawn to big questions and systems-level thinking. I believe in the power of storytelling to inspire action and in the quiet, persistent work it takes to build solutions that last.

That storytelling instinct comes from a background in classical dance, public speaking, and cultural representation. As 2nd Runner-Up at Miss India USA 2023 and a Top 5 finalist at Miss India Worldwide 2024, I’ve learned how to lead with presence, connect across cultures, and speak to both heart and intellect.

I’m currently preparing to pursue a PhD focused on human-robot interaction, reinforcement learning, and multimodal AI — with ethical design at the center.

I don’t have all the answers.
But I’ve learned to ask better questions —
And I’m building technology that listens, not just responds.
